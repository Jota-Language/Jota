# The Jota programming language!
## A W.I.P. language implemented in Go!

NOTE: At the moment, this is not meant for production like, at all! You may have also noticed that this is exactly the same as [Lox from CraftingInterpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). This is because this language is my first, and I thought that implementing Lox first and then building upon the quite solid foundation it offers would be a good idea.

## Installation:
- `git clone https://github.com/mattishere/jota.git && cd jota && sudo make install` (Careful!)
- You might be interested in [releases](https://github.com/mattishere/jota/releases) instead.

## Usage:
- `jota`: opens the REPL
- `jota [file.jota]`: runs a .jota file

# Examples:
- You can find some basic examples [here](https://github.com/mattishere/jota/tree/main/examples).
